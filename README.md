## :hammer: How to see the contents on the browser

The directory 'src' have the contents separated by subject, to see each subject on the browser you have to go to the file 'index.js' of the 'src' directory and change the path of this import:
`import App from "./smart-components/App";`
to the path of the directory that you want to see, and of course, run 'npm start' on the terminal.
For example, if you want to see the directory 'dumb-components' on the browser, just change the import to:
`import App from "./dumb-components/App";`

:computer: Happy hacking!
